File processing has a series of dockers

csv-producer: Produce one CSV file every INTERVAL_SECONDS with rows between MIN_ROWS and MAX_ROWS and place in incoming dir

csv-consumer: Consume CSV files every INTERVAL_SECONDS - move from "incoming" dir to "processing" dir to "processed" dir

csv-archiver: Delete CSV files  every INTERVAL_SECONDS  from "processed" dir
